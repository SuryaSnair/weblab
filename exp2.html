<p><h3>Web technology is a collective name for technology primarily for the world wide web. This does, however, tend to focus more specifically towards technology that aides in the creation, maintenance and development of web-based applications.
From a developers point of view, these are things like languages and frameworks, data storage mechanisms, services and products to allow us to create platforms and applications for the web.</h3></p>
<p><h3>Web technology is the mechanism which enables two of computer devices to communicate over a network’s maturation. In a normal office setting, for example, quite a few computers and additional devices like printers might be connected allowing for suitable and fast transmission of data. The procedures are varied and complicated, which explains companies employ departments to take care of the matter. Internet technologies has generated surgeries a lot more efficient and has revolutionized communication techniques.</h3></p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Benefits of Web Technologies</h3></li>
<p>The most important benefit of internet technologies is that it provides convenience and a higher speed of communicating in the computer world. Whether at the house or the workplace, processes are simple and swift. Internet technology makes it possible for messages whereas earlier it might have been required depart from your workspace or to use a runner. It’s obvious to see how internet technology creates a business more effective and minimizes costs, increasing business prospective.</p>
<li><h3>Disadvantages of Internet Technologies</h3></li>
<p> Things involving net technology can be quite complex, and it would be problematic for somebody without related experience to form a community issue out. This implies it is required to employ a person with the skills to resolve. The presence of a system provides the chance for an assault within the computer program. Weaknesses in a community could be manipulated; the systems could be infected by malware and significant information can be damaged or stolen.</p>
</ul>
<p><h3>Web technologies are the various tools and techniques that are utilised in the process of communication between different types of devices over the internet.p
To understand this term in a better manner, let’s break it down into two pieces: ‘web’ and ‘technology’.
The web, in this case, refers to the World Wide Web, more commonly known as WWW. It first came into being in 1989 when famous scientist and engineer, Tim Berners-Lee, came up with an efficient mechanism to share resources between scientists all over the world.</h3></p>

<li><h3>Quality Web Content</h3>There’s one primary reason people use search engines and browse websites, and that is to search for information. People desire information everyday, and want if delivered in a fast and reliable fashion. Whether to entertain, entice or educate, superior content is a must in every frequently visited website, especially if search engine optimisation is part of the website's overarching marketing strategy.

For business websites, content should include important information and come in the forms that are pertinent to the business. Retail sites for example, need high quality pictures of their products, while consulting firms are more apt to highlight client testimonials. A best practice for most search engine optimisation gurus is also ensuring the most relevant content is prominent on the webpages.</li>

<li><h3>Clear, User-friendly Navigation</h3>A stellar web design must contain a user-friendly navigation scheme that allows visitors to quickly find the information needed. Important links must be easy to find and given logical, simple, and include easy-to-understand labels. Calls to action are placed in conspicuous spots within the navigation’s scheme. If there is a plethora of content, then a search box is suggested to make it faster to reach more specific pages within a website.</li>

<li><h3>Simple and Professional Web Design</h3>Bells and whistles may seem nice in concept, but they rarely add much value to an effectively constructed and sensible web design. Typically, the websites best at effectively converting site visitors into buying customers, maintain an attractive layout, but keep it clean and simple. Google is an excellent example of such a site. Actually, users found Google’s initial design over simplified during the initial testing phases. Thus in order to keep a simple interface, but prevent the appearance of site constructed without much thought, Google added the ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ button underneath the search box. Despite the fact that hardly anyone clicks on this button, its addition balances the layout in such a way that delivers a better user experience.

To keep websites simple, without making them look bland such as in Google’s case, a balanced distribution of content and graphics is required and the use of slightly contrasting colours and clear fonts is key. Visit http://www.thewebshowroom.com.au/balancing-web-graphics-text/ for more information on balancing graphics and content in any site's web design. Colours that are scream, are overtly contrasting, and font sizes that are difficult to read will put a strain on visitors’ eyes.Also, one should break up sizeable blocks of text with either spacing or images as appropriate.</li>

<li> <h3>Webpage Speed</h3>People inherently lose patience quickly, and that holds true when visiting a website. The longer a website takes to load, the more likely a person will leave before it fully renders. Beautiful graphics and substantial content become useless if a site’s speed hampers its ability to deliver content quickly.

Several factors affect site speed, including server speed, the number of graphics, website traffic, etc. A web design company must make sure to minimise all controllable factors slowing down site speed by using reliable site hosting, proper website code, and optimised graphics.</li>

<li><h3>Search Engine Optimisation</h3>A well-designed website generally will receive many visitors, and one method to attract visitors is search engine optimisation. This entails the insertion of search keywords in website content, an appropriate link profile, social media signals, and over 200 other factors. Just as The Web Showroom developed a resources setion for web design, we also created a search engine optimisation resources to help company's improve their rankings.</li>

<li><h3>Web Compatibility</h3>The variety of browser and platforms which one can now be view web design can present a challenge to developers, but talented ones are accustomed to handling such factors. A site should easily render on various resolutions, screen sizes, and browsers; and with the increasing popularity of mobile devices, websites should function properly on the plethora of these types of devices.</li>

<p><h3>According to Microsoft, web technologies include the following:</h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Mark-up languages, such as HTML, CSS, XML, CGI, and HTTP (Front-end or Client-side technologies)</li>
<li>Programming languages and technologies that help create applications for the web. Some of these are Perl, C#, Java, Visual Basic, and .NET (Back-end or Server-side technologies)</li>
<li>Web server and server technologies that enable request handling on a network, where different users have to share the same resources and communicate with each other</li>
<li>Databases, which are extremely important for data and information storage on a computer network</li>
<li>Business applications that are customized for specific execution of tasks on a network</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several programming languages and technologies for the Web. Some of the most popular websites, ranging from Google to YouTube and from Amazon to twitter are built using these server-side technologies. The latter include ASP.NET, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PERL, Python, PHP, Ruby, and more. We shall discuss the most popular current website technologies in this guide. So, without further ado, let’s begin…</p>

<li><h3>HTML5:</h3> If you know this programming language, knowing all the others is a walk in the park. This recent addition to the HTML family is very equipped and potent in assisting in web development activities.</li>
<li><h3>JavaScript:</h3> This programming language lets you make communication for your website. It was developed by Netscape and borrows a lot of its syntax from the C language. Using JavaScript, you can manage your browser, edit content on a document, let client-side scripts interact with users, and also enable asynchronous communication. JavaScript is generally used for including animations on web pages, loading new images, scripts or objects onto a web page, and creating extremely receptive user interfaces.</li>
<li><h3>Java:</h3>This is the top programming language in the industry and is currently the perfect language for web development. Created by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s, this language is not platform dependent, so using Java and creating Java-based applications is extremely easy.</li>
<li><h3>PHP:</h3> This stands for PHP Hypertext Processor. It is one of the widely-used languages for web development and was created in 2004. It is an HTML-embedded scripting language and is useful for creating dynamic web pages. Using this language you can expand a web app very quickly. This language has been used to create websites such as WordPress, Digg, and Facebook.</li>
<li><h3>Python:</h3> This is an advanced programming language and is used for creating websites and mobile apps. It is very flexible and has a broad range of applications. It can run on both Linux and Windows-based servers. Some of the sites powered by Python include Instagram and Pinterest, both social media sites.</li>
<li><h3>Ruby:</h3> This is a user-friendly language for beginners. It is used for the programming of mobile apps and websites. Created in 1993, Ruby is an open-source platform that is not only easy to understand, but also to write. For those who are interested in creating small business software or for those who are into creative designing, Ruby is the perfect programming language.</li>
<li><h3>.NET:</h3> This was created by Microsoft in the year 2000. Though it is used primarily in systems running on Windows, this language is used in scientific research and academic fields, thereby more than making up for this feature.</li>
<li><h3>Perl:</h3> This is an interpreted script language and presents unique tools for system programming.</li>
<li><h3>C:</h3> This is a standard programming language created in the 1970s. It is appreciated for its efficiency and is known for writing system software. It is also used for writing applications. This language can be easily compiled by using a simple compiler. It support cross-platform programming.</li>
<li><h3>C++:</h3> This is an intermediary programming language, initially designed to boost the C language. Created in the year 1979, it is a very powerful language, and is used in very important operating systems, such as Windows.</li>
<li><h3>C#:</h3> This is a multi-paradigm programming language and is a general-purpose language, used to build up software for the Microsoft and Windows platforms.</li>
<li><h3>SQL:</h3> This stands for Structured Query Language and is a necessary part of web development. Using this language, web developers can obtain data from large and multifaceted databases.</li>

<p>As we go further, we will discuss individual web development technologies and tools used to create websites. But before that, we need to be clear on the two distinct parts of a website: the frontend and the backend.

<h3>Frontend</h3>It refers to all those parts of a website that a user can see on their screen and interact with.

<h3>Backend</h3>It refers to the exact opposite of that. It involves the hidden mechanisms that make a webpage function. A typical user is generally unaware of what goes on at the backend.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>TCP(Transmission Control Protocol):</h3> For establishing a connection between two devices on the web and managing the delivery of data packets</li>
<li><h3>IP(Internet Protocol):</h3> For transferring data packets between two devices on the web</li>
<li><h3>TCP/IP:</h3>These two web technologies often work together.</li>
<li><h3>UDP(User Datagram Protocol):</h3>For establishing a connection between two devices on the web</li>
<li><h3>FTP(File Transfer Protocol):</h3>For transferring files between the client and the server</li>
<li><h3>SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</h3>For sending email messages to the server</li>
<li><h3>POP(Post Office Protocol):</h3>For fetching email messages from the server</li>
<li><h3>SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol):</h3>For sending XML messages via HTTP</li>

<p>A report by Cisco predicts that almost 52% of the world’s population will have access to the internet by the year 2020. The World Wide Web will grow at astonishing rates to include a higher number of people, devices, and resources available online. Therefore, web technologies are expected to scale up. Consequently, tech professionals will strive harder to provide accessible web content to users everywhere. Tougher security measures will have to be taken to protect private web content from malicious cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The WWW started as Web 1.0 with static web pages written in plain old HTML. It then moved on to Web 2.0 with the advent of JavaScript and other technologies that enabled users to interact with web content and produce their own.</p>
<p>Soon, the Web will go a step further and enter its third phase, i.e. Web 3.0, which will be far more decentralised than it is today. Modern technologies such as AI and IoT will soon dominate the Web. Everything will be much more automated in terms of both development and consumption of new content.</p>
